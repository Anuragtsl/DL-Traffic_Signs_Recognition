# DL-Traffic_Signs_Recognition

I have created a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53) for Classifying Traffic signs.

I have created an [GUI](https://github.com/Anuragtsl/DL-Traffic_Signs_Recognition/blob/main/gui.py) format for using the model.

I have used [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

# Traffic Signs Dataset

The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes.

The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images.

The size of the dataset is around 300 MB. The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.
